#### Emotion Detection WebApp

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is one of the most researched fields of computer vision to detect the emotion of a person from his/her facial expressions.

FER2013 Dataset was used for analysis and **Emotion Detection WebApp** was created with Streamlit for the recognition of facial expressions with the FER library. The labels of the library can identify seven main emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral) and shows the analysis results according to their detection rates on an image.
